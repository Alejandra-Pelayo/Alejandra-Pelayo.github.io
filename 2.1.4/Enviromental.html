In recent years humans have observed a change in Earth’s climate all over the world; this global epidemic is better known as global warming. The increase in temperature has to do with the combustion of fossil fuels including petroleum which is used to power vehicles as well as many factory used machines. When these fossil fuels are burned there is an emission of chemicals deposited in the air; these chemicals will become a new addition to the already existing substances in the atmosphere. The addition of these chemicals cause a greenhouse effect that enables the sun’s radiation to escape Earth’s atmosphere after it has interacted with the planet. The increased substances in the atmosphere create a type of insulator that in turn allows the sun’s rays to enter, but upon leaving Earth, there is no opening for the energy to escape. If this energy cannot escape then it will begin a cycle that consists of bouncing off the atmosphere, bouncing off earth’s surface,  and returning to the atmosphere until the ray can find an opening that allows it to escape into space.</font>
