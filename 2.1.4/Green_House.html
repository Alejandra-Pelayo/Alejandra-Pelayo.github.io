      <p> The best way to minimize our production of greenhouse gases is to be more conscious of our carbon footprint. A carbon footprint represents all the carbon dioxide a person produces in their daily life: carbon dioxide is a very prominent greenhouse gas. Some activities that involve the production of carbon include driving petroleum based vehicles, producing an excessive amount of trash, using household hold appliances, and using an abundance of water and electricity. All the items listed in some way release a certain amount of carbon in the air due to burning the fossil fuels that are used as a power source. Solutions to minimize their emission include depending upon a different form of power such as wind and solar panels as well as investing in an electric vehicle or integrating the use of public transportation. It is also important to be mindful not to buy single use items that are constantly thrown away and invest in items that can be used repeatedly.
